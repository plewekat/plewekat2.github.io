      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

      <p>The rule of thirds indicates that the points of interest in a visual field are located in the intersections and lines of the field split equally 3 ways, vertically and horizontally. In addition, classical landscape proportions call for a 2/3 1/3 split between elements above and below the horizon line. As seen here, the astronauts take up the bottom 3rd of the image, while the background occupies the remaining 2/3 of the image.</p>

      <h2>Repetition</h2>

      <p>Repetition plays on the mind's instinct to find connections and similarities in shapes and concepts. By repeating visual elements in a page, the eye knows that these elements are grouped together. Joss and Main repeats text colors and styles, as well as color choices throughout their website.</p>

      <h2>Contrast</h2>

      <p>There must be sufficient contrast, taking into account size, weight, and color, for information to be transmitted effectively. This is especially important in web design, when text is included. Sufficient contrast makes that text more readable. Tesla does a good job of creating contrast between the text and the background image. This is also an example of good use of negative space.</p>
