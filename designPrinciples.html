      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <img src="" alt="thirdsImage">
      <p>The rule of thirds indicates that the points of interest in a visual field are located in the intersections and lines of the field split equally 3 ways, vertically and horizontally. In addition, classical landscape proportions call for a 2/3 1/3 split between elements above and below the horizon line.</p>

      <h2>Repetition</h2>
      <p>Repetition plays on the mind's instinct to find connections and similarities in shapes and concepts. By repeating visual elements in a page, the eye knows that these elements are grouped together.</p>

      <h2>Contrast</h2>
      <p>There must be sufficient contrast, taking into account size, weight, and color, for information to be transmitted effectively. This is especially important in web design, when text is included. Sufficient contrast makes that text more readable.</p>
